### Week 1 instructions:

Create a new directory (folder) in this repo with your first name as the name of the directory. Then create two files in that
directory called `first_python.py` and `first_yaml.yaml`. Submit a PR (pull request) with your changes. Note: never
work on the master branch, always create your own branch!

1. Get on the master branch
2. Pull changes
3. Create a new branch and switch to that branch
4. Create a directory (folder) with your first name as the name of the directory

5. Move into your newly created directory
6. Create two files in the directory called `first_python.py` and `first_yaml.yaml`
     - it's a good idea to do a quick `git status` now and see that your files were created
